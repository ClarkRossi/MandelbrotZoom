1. In this folder you will find another folder called "javacv"
   in order for this program to run this must be in the root of the drive you wish to run the program in.
 
2. This program comes with two batch files, run.bat and compile.bat.
   These programs are use for compiling and running the mandZoom.java and consist of a file path pointing 
   mandZoom.java to the javacv folder.
   In order for this to run the file path in these files needs to match the drive name you are running the 
   program on. Mine was my f drive, yours may vary and needs to be changed.
   
3. When compiling the mand file type compile.bat mandZoom.java in your terminal.
   When running the program type run.bat mandZoom <desiredVideoName>.wmv.
   My program is currently only set up to create wmv files but you can change this if you wish.
   
WARNING: Depending on how long of a video you are creating and the depth of you zoom this program may take several minutes to several hours. 
		I personally recommend not creating videos over 1 minute in length to avoid this.  

Enjoy!
